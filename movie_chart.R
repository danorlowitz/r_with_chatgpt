## Leaving in what ChatGPT gave me below because I now realize I was asking for the wrong thing.

#   geom_boxplot(orientation = "h") +
#   xlab("Release date difference (U.S. - Japan)") +
#   ylab("Movie") +
#   # Sort movies in chronological order
#   coord_flip(ylim = c("Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope", "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back", "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi", "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace", "Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones", "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith", "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story", "Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens", "Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi", "Solo: A Star Wars Story", "Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker"))
